# MazatronSmartPump
This app connects with Mazatron GSM based Smart Tubewells and Pumps and can be controlled from anywhere in the world.

***This app utilises a background service and the Alarm Manager for scheduling and automating tasks, we do not store any data whatsoever with this app. It uses SMS for communicating to the device, hence pretty usefull if there is no internet available***

You will need the following device for full functionality:

Since the SMS permission was gone this app now utilises the default messaging app for the android phone and the background schedule features are also gone in the app on playstore:

But this repository has all the functionalities, so you can build the source and after opening the *Developer Options* in your android phone and installing the app. If someday Google decides to give back the permissions we weill replace the app with full functionalities ....
